# Automatic-Email-Attachment-Extractor

Our project is to automate the process of downloading the attachment from an email into the required directory. This software will mainly be used by students and individuals working in the industry as people find it hard to keep track of all the downloaded and partially downloaded files because of the sheer volume of emails received. Along with this, we will provide the functionality of downloading the email attachment in the appropriate directory.
The user will be able to perform the following functions-
• Download the email attachment having a specific subject
• Attachments can be saved in different folders based on the
requirement of the user

We have used imap protocol in python for accessing the emails.
For the UI (front end), we have used streamlit to accept username and password of the user’s email account.
